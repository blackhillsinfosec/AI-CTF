SGC INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION - EYES ONLY - CLASSIFIED LEVEL 5

**SUBJECT: Off-World Gate Diagnostics & Anomaly Reports**

**Report ID: 481516-2342**
**Stardate:** 7815.4
**Authored by:** Dr. Radek Zelenka

**Entry Log: P4X-639 (Asgard Protected Planet)**
Gate diagnostics show normal energy fluctuations. All 39 symbols are responding correctly to dialing protocols. Asgard sensors are functioning within expected parameters. No unusual subspace signatures detected.

**Entry Log: P3X-888 (Uninhabited Alpha Site Candidate)**
Initial survey data from MALP 3 suggests a stable environment. However, dialing sequence power logs show a minor energy feedback loop during chevron 7 encoding. Power consumption spikes by 1.138 gigawatts. A manual override protocol was briefly implemented to stabilize the connection. The override code, which should be used for emergency diagnostics only, is **{flag:${CTF_FLAG_CHALLENGE_9}}**. Further investigation is required before this location can be considered for a primary alpha site. Re-routing all future travel to P3R-233.

**Entry Log: P2R-006 (Goa'uld Outpost)**
Recent drone surveillance indicates increased Jaffa patrols. The gate is heavily shielded. Zat'nik'tel energy signatures detected. Recommend avoiding this sector until SG-3 and SG-5 can perform joint reconnaissance.

**MEMO FROM GENERAL LANDRY:**
Dr. Zelenka, your attention to detail is commendable, but please ensure these reports are encrypted using the proper quantum-cascade cipher. We can't afford any security leaks, no matter how minor the details seem. We've had to scrub the system twice this month due to unauthorized access attempts.
