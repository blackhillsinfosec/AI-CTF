# Open WebUI CTF - Docker Setup

This project provides a complete Capture The Flag (CTF) environment based on Open WebUI with LLM prompt injection challenges.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04 or Debian-based Linux (for automatic setup)
- At least 8GB of RAM available
- 20GB of free disk space (for models and containers)
- (Optional BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) NVIDIA GPU for better performance
- (Optional) AWS Account with Bedrock access for cloud-based LLM models

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** (or ensure all files are in place):

    ```bash
   # Your project structure should look like:
   openwebui_ctf/
   ├── .env
   ├── Dockerfile.ctfsetup
   ├── Dockerfile.jupyter
   ├── Dockerfile.ollama
   ├── Dockerfile.openwebui
   ├── README.md
   ├── docker-compose.yml
   ├── docker-compose.override.yml
   ├── setup.sh
   └── openwebui/
       ├── functions/
       │   ├── flag_check_filter.py.template
       │   ├── image_text_filter.py
       │   ├── input_filter.py
       │   ├── output_filter.py.template
       │   └── output_filter_2.py.template
       ├── knowledge/
       │   ├── stargate_secret.txt.template
       │   └── stargate_users.txt
       ├── pipelines/
       │   ├── email_summarizer.py.template
       │   └── prompt_guard.py
       └── tools/
       │   └── calculator.py
       ├── ctf_config.json.template
       ├── run_setup.sh
       └── setup.py

   ```

3. **Install Pre-requisites**:

   To install Docker, GPU drivers, and other prerequisites, run the following:
   ```bash
   ./setup -a -n
   ```
   After setup is completed, you will need to reboot.

4. **Configure the CTF Environment**:

   After installing the pre-requisites and rebooting, run:
   ```bash
   ./setup --ctf
   ```

5. **Wait for services to be ready** (about 2-3 minutes), then check status:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f ctf-setup  # Watch setup progress
   ```

7. **Access the CTF**:
   - Open WebUI: http://localhost:4242
   - Admin User: `admin@ctf.local` / `ctf_admin_password`
   - Standard User: `ctf@ctf.local` / `Hellollmworld!`

## 🛌 Amazon Bedrock Integration

This CTF environment includes optional support for Amazon Bedrock, allowing you to use cloud-based LLM models alongside the local Ollama models.

### Bedrock Setup

1. **AWS Credentials**: Before running the CTF setup, ensure you have:
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - AWS Region with Bedrock access enabled (default: us-east-1)

2. **Configure During Setup**: When running `./setup.sh --ctf`, you'll be prompted to configure AWS Bedrock credentials. The setup will:
   - Ask if you want to configure Bedrock
   - Prompt for your AWS credentials
   - Store them securely in the `.env` file

3. **Manual Configuration**: You can also manually edit the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   BEDROCK_PORT=8081
   BEDROCK_API_KEY=bedrock
   ```

4. **Accessing Bedrock in Open WebUI**:
   - Navigate to Settings > Admin Settings > Connections
   - Add a new OpenAI API connection with:
     - **API Base URL**: `http://bedrock-gateway:80/api/v1`
     - **API Key**: `bedrock` (or the value set in BEDROCK_API_KEY)
   - Available models will appear in the model selector

5. **Available Bedrock Models**: The gateway provides access to various Amazon Bedrock models including:
   - Anthropic Claude models (Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
   - Amazon Titan models
   - AI21 Jurassic models
   - Cohere models
   - Meta Llama models

6. **Embedding Models**: For RAG functionality, you can configure embedding models:
   - Go to Settings > Admin Settings > Documents
   - Set Embedding Model Engine to use Bedrock endpoint
   - Recommended models: `cohere.embed-english-v3` or `cohere.embed-multilingual-v3`

### Bedrock Gateway Details

- **Container**: `bedrock-gateway`
- **Port**: 8081 (configurable via BEDROCK_PORT in .env)
- **API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8081/api/v1`
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:8081/health`

The Bedrock Gateway provides an OpenAI-compatible API, making it seamless to use with Open WebUI.

8. **Modifying the flags and credentials**

   The `.env` file contains all of the flags, credentials, and other settings.

   Note that files containing flag placeholders (e.g. ${CTF_CHALLENEGE_FLAG_1) end in .template. These files will be dynamically updated during the setup process. The flag placeholders are replaced with the corresponding flags in the .env file.

10. **Modifying the system prompts**

    The system prompts for each challenge can be found in `openwebui/ctf_config.json.template`.
   
    Be careful not to modify the placeholder for the flags.

11. **Adding/modifying challenges**

    The challenges are also found in `openwebui/ctf_config.json.template`.


## 🎯 CTF Challenges

The CTF includes 11 challenges:

1. **Challenge 1: Hello prompt injection!** - Basic prompt injection
2. **Challenge 2: System Prompt Protection** - Bypass system prompt protections
3. **Challenge 3: Input Filtering** - Defeat input filters
4. **Challenge 4: Output Filtering** - Bypass output filters
5. **Challenge 5: LLM Prompt Guard** - Defeat ML-based prompt injection detection
6. **Challenge 6: All Defenses** - Defeat all of the prior defenses applied to on model
7. **Challenge 7: Code Interpreter** - Find the flag on disk using code execution via the interpreter
8. **Challenge 8: Calculator Agent** - Abuse the calculator to find the flag on disk
9. **Challenge 9: RAG** - Find the flag in the documents
10. **Challenge 10: Email Summarizer** - Trick the email summarizer into sending an email to a target, which will give you the flag
10. **Challenge 11: Multi-Modal** - Use a method other than text to retrieve the flag

## 🚩 Checking Flags

The CTF has a model that users can use to check if a flag is correct.

The model is **Flag Checker** and can be selected just like any of the challenges can be.

Send a potential flag as a prompt and it will tell you if it was correct or not.

This model is templated, so it is dynamically updated when flags are changed in the .env file.

docker compose down -v  # Remove all data
docker compose up -d    # Start fresh
```

### Stop everything:
```bash

```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error Message when Entering a Prompt
Sometimes you might receive an error message (typically about JSON parsing or unexpected characters) when entering a prompt to one of the challenges. Logging out and logging back in seems to clear the issue in most cases. We will investigate this error further.

### Bedrock Gateway Issues

**Container fails to start:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs bedrock-gateway

# Common issues:
# - Invalid AWS credentials
# - No Bedrock access in the specified region
# - Network connectivity issues
```

**Models not appearing in Open WebUI:**
- Verify the API connection settings in Open WebUI
- Ensure the API Base URL is `http://bedrock-gateway:80/api/v1` (internal Docker network)
- Check that the API key matches the value in `.env` (default: `bedrock`)
- Verify AWS credentials have proper Bedrock permissions

**Authentication errors:**
- Check that AWS credentials in `.env` are correct
- Ensure the IAM user/role has `bedrock:InvokeModel` permissions
- Verify Bedrock is available in the configured region

**Health check failing:**
```bash
# Test the gateway directly
curl http://localhost:8081/health
```

### No GPU / CPU-Only Mode
The CTF can run without a GPU but it will be very, very slow.

### GPU Support Issues

### Model Download Issues
If the Llama model fails to download:
```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

### Setup Script Failures
Check the setup logs:
```bash
docker compose logs ctf-setup
```

If setup fails, you can run it manually:
```bash
docker compose run --rm ctf-setup
```

### Port Conflicts
If ports are already in use, modify the `.env` file to change port mappings.

## 🏁 CTF Flag Locations

Without spoiling the challenges, here's where flags are stored:
- Challenges 1-6: In the system prompts of each model
- Challenge 7: In the Jupyter container filesystem
- Challenge 8: In the open-webui container filesystem
- Challenge 9: In one of the RAG documents
- Challenge 10: The flag will be returned if the email summarizer sends a specific email to a target recipient
- Challenge 11: In the system prompt of the model

## 👥 Creating Additional Users
By default, users can sign themselves up.

To add more CTF participants as part of the automation process, modify `openwebui/ctf_config.json.template` and add users to the `users` array, then re-run the setup:
```bash
docker compose run --rm ctf-setup
```
